Day four. i was busy yesterday. burying the bodies. yknow. of the people (all of them)

Seperated statebase script into hitbox script.

Hitbox adds two timers and a collisionshape when added in the editor.

Today im going through YOMIH to find more parameters for characters states and hitboxes.
heres a quick list.
### Characters
1. Ground / Air friction
2. Max Ground / Air speed
3. Max Fall speed
4. Damage taken multiplier
5. KB taken multiplier
6. Hitstun multiplier
7. Controlled states
### States
1. Apply physics 
2. Custom physics (friction / damping, max speed, max fall speed)
3. Custom mults (damage, kb, hitstun)
4. Force
5. Impulse
6. Screenshake
7. Particles
8. Sfx
9. Projectile
10. Allow flip for..
### Hitboxes
1. Screenshake
2. Guardbreak
3. Knockback + dir
4. KB from centre of HB
5. KB from centre of host
6. Hitstun
7. Damage

Its a lot. theres a lot of them.

Also, need support for charging moves and for status effects.

I've added the exports + descriptions detailed above for characters.
I've also added the function damp(), which will be used for friction and stuff. It functions independently from framerate.
