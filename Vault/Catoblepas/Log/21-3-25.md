day one. everybody is dead. all that's left is godot and obsidian.

The idea for this game was pitched literally an hour ago by [[Mikel]], who has been asking people for their characters' movesets for a while now.

For now, I just want to set up a godot project and a system for how it'll all function.

I'm thinking a statemachine for each character with many states:
1. Idle.
2. Falling. 
3. Melee (dir).
4. Block.
5. Grab.
6. Grab -> Success.
7. Side Special.
8. Down Special.
9. Neutral Special. 
10. Neutral Special -> Ultimate
11. Up Special - Recovery.
And any other states that might be required on a per-character basis.

Having discussed this with Ben it's a smidge unclear. will talk to Mikel.
Maybe we can figure out a control map that will help it all make sense.

Assuming controller. KBM will be available, but will be developed for controller satisfaction.
