day whatever... whatever has wehat.ever...

hitbox detection !
no tests or anything, just framework.

three different ways to do knockback direction;
- custom
in a static direction. good for launches and slams.
- away from hitbox
away from the hitbox's position. Notably, the area, not the shape.
- away from player position
away from the centre of the player's hurtbox. This is taken as the "centre of mass."

Then it's normalised and multiplied by the strength and by multipliers.

for knockback scaling with damage taken i just have it linear at the moment. 
not sure if i'll keep it like that.

Renamed a few variables and turned an empty function into a signal.

I think i have a solution in mind for the friction problem:
instead of having some abstract value, have an amount of time: how long it takes to drop from max speed to 0 when not pressing a direction.

Just need to choose an easing method.

Also this is a #TODO. Lol. Haha.

GitIgnore is a Piece Of Shit. 
I WILL find a way to break you!!! i will fix it!!! i will break its spirit!!!!

P.S. Yes you are ben. you are the weirdest loser i've ever met. i wouldnt be friends with you if you werent
