Jump cancelling!
When you release the jump key before the first half of the upwards velocity has dissipated, said velocity will halve. 

Moved hitstun processing below knockback. Means that knockback will actually do things when hitstun is also applied.

Coyote time is still there, but it's fixed now! :)

Gave Hurtboxes a class name to help make them distinct from hitboxes. 

Started work on stages !!
Death planes and camera stuff is going on.
Death planes extend from some variable amount past the edge of the stage sprite in all directions. At the moment, when a player's hurtbox enters a deathplane, its position will be set to 80 above the centrepoint of the stage sprite.

OKAY! Here's what the camera is doing.
At runtime, it first iterates over all collisionshapes that are children of staticbodies and constructs a rect2 that contains it all. Then it grows it a little bit and finds the greatest zoom of the camera that will contain that entire rect, and it finds the least zoom of the camera that will be entirely contained within the stage sprite.

Then every frame, it first locks the zoom to that range, then clamps the top left corner of the camera rect to between the top left corners of the sprite rect and the terrain rect, and clamps the bottom right corner between the bottom right corners.

So yeah [[Ben (1.0)]] is doing the rest of that. Make it all run before the clamping stuff just described!
