i should really be doing other stuff. i have schoolwork to do

used kinematic equations to find jump strength from jump height.
that was a fun one.

Also. A lot has been done with mov ement.
## player movement
- Friction 
damp velocity towards 0
- Gravity
move velocity.y towards terminal velocity by gravity\*delta
- Terminal velocity
fastest that the player can fall due to gravity
- Horizontal input
accelerates player horizontally - force\*delta
- Max Speed
limits speed on the ground and in the air.
- Jump Strength

##### Strengths
Highly modal. 
Changeable from state to state. 
All functional!
##### Weaknesses
The numbers are a little odd and hard to understand.
Without a proper scale (ie. a sprite), they're impossible to fine-tune.
Friction isn't applied properly / in a way that makes sense or looks good. 


I've [found a pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/papers/sig91.pdf) about application of friction for rigid-body simulations and hope to use the information held within to fix the weird friction i've got going on.
Otherwise, movement is like. done i think. or the base of it is. any weird loser movement tech that any of the weird losers (my friends) come up with is very much not done.
