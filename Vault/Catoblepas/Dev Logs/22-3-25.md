Day two. Everyone is still dead.

Mikel is working in this vault now!! Very cool, very epic.
I'm still adding in a ton of exported variables and documenting those in code.
Coming along well.
The player's hitbox for movement collisions should be different from the hitbox for getting hit.
Movement will be a collisionshape under a characterbody, getting hit will be a collisionshape under an area2d.

This has been done now.

Also, working on character movement.
Just basic at the moment. I think it's going to be a constant speed for now, but i'll change that to a more satisfying acceleration-based movement later.
Or maybe I won't. It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense with most animations.

Also, working on animation setup.
The animation key now changes with state changes. 
Even though I truly have not implemented state changes.

oouughh. made a note on [[HTMAEC]] - state changes are linked to animations and scripting.
during an animation, whenever the frame changes, 

Cleaned up much of the file system.
