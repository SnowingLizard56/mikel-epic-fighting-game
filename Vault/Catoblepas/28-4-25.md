back into it  !!!
its only been likeee. almost a month. 

the status effect parameters of hitboxes are now used in the hit() function in characters.

also the timers go down over. yknow, time.

Brittle and Bleed both ~~work~~ have code written for them. they don't interact atm, but they could.

The bleed code is a little janky - it'll skip a damage tick if two are supposed to happen in the same frame. This can be avoided if the time between ticks is kept above 0.05s. This *is* currently framerate dependent, but bleed tick times should be a bit higher than that anyway. oopsei!
The first tick of bleed damage is AFTER the delay.

The jump side of impede is fun :) i like kinematic equations. The other movement side is good too thats there. and done. :) yay



Again, i haven't actually tested a single goddamn line of any of this code. 

Danger.
