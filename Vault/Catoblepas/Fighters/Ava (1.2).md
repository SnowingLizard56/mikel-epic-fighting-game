| Side        | Book whack     | Whacks to the side with a bag of books.                                                                                                                                                                          | Can be performed at the end of combos for additional damage.                    |
| Air Down    | Book Slam      | The player throws several books beneath them, and the stack produced also doubles as a platform temporarily.                                                                                                     |                                                                                 |
| Ground Down | Book Stack     | Summon a stack of books that deals heavy knockback to anyone caught.  This also creates a small platform temporarily before tumbling down.                                                                       |                                                                                 |
| Neutral     | Fast reader    | Stands still, reading a book. Flips the pages so fast that others are blown away by the wind it generates.                                                                                                       | ~0.5s windup<br>Powers down gradually the longer it continues                   |
| Recovery    | Future paper   | Throws a book down, which proceeds to sprout a tree, which pushes the player and damages everything in its path.                                                                                                 | Can be interrupted during the climb (Tree is destroyed)                         |
| Ultimate    | Bibliofication | Place a high HP altar at current position and transform the stage into a library which applies full [[silence]], because you can't shout one liners in a library. Altar lasts for 10 seconds or until destroyed. | Must be grounded to activate.<br>Player is immune - you can't shush a librarian |
